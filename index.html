			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I transferred from Bellevue College to Eastern in the Fall of 2012 planning to get a degree in Psychology. Half way through the quarter I realized this wasn't the right major for me for multiple reasons, so I changed my major to Technical Communication. I haven't regretted it for a second. I am currently enrolled in my final three classes required for my dgree. In December I will return home to Seattle, Washington with the goal of finding a job in my field. I chose Technical Communication because I wanted an English major, and I wanted to become an Editor. Because there are five design classes that are built into my Technical Communication major, I declared a minor in Visual Communication Design. When debating choosing Technical Communication, the five design courses originally deterred me. I didn't see myself as creative and artistic, and had no background in using design programs. Although I had a large learning curve at first, I finally started to enjoy designing. </p>

			<h3>Professional Objective</h3>
			<p>With the writing, editing, designing, journalism, and communication skills I've gained during this degree, my career options are endless. With a major in Technical Communication and a minor in Design, my career goal is to be an Editor. While this originally was intended for content, I'm now open and knowledgeable about editing design, and doing document design. Because of all the various concentrations I learned, I can fit into many different types of Editing roles.</p>
