			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I transferred from Bellevue College in the Fall of 2012 planning to get a degree in Psychology. I had been debating between Psychology and English, but chose Psychology because I thought English degrees only taught literature classes. Half way through my first quarter, I realized Psychology wasn't the right major for me. I returned to peruse Eastern's English degrees and saw that Technical Communication taught writing in the workplace. My only hesitation were the five design classes included in the course list. But I ultimately decided to go for it. I signed up for Tech Comm classes Winter quarter and haven't regretted it for a second. I've loved my classes, and I'm so excited to apply everything I've learned in a career. This Fall is my final quarter at Eastern Washington University. I walked for graduation in the spring with my fellow tech comm classmates, and will return home in December to begin my career.</p>

			<h3>Professional Objective</h3>
			<p>I want to be an Editor for both content and design. For many years I've wanted a desk job where I can write. Now that I've taken design classes, I want that included in my job description. With the writing, editing, design, journalism, and communication skills I've gained during this degree, my career options are endless. Because of the various concentrations I've studied, I can fit into many different Editing roles.</p>
