		<h2>Major</h2>
		<p>I transferred from Bellevue College to Eastern in the Fall of 2012 planning to get a degree in Psychology. Half way through the quarter I realized this wasn't a good idea for multiple reasons, so I changed my major to Technical Communication. I haven't regretted it for a minute. I am currently enrolled in my final three classes required for my dgree, then will return home in December to Seattle, Washington with a Bacherlor of Arts in Technical Communication and a minor in Visual Communication Design. I chose Technical Communication because I wanted an English degree, and I wanted to become an Editor. Since taking five design courses, I'm now open to editing both content and design, and doing document design. With the writing, editing, designing, journalism, and communication skills I've gained during this degree, my career options are endless.</p>

		<h2>Minor</h2>
		<p>Because there are five design classes that are built into my Technicla Communication major, I declared the minor. When debating choosing Technical Communication, the five design courses originally deterred me. I didn't see myself as creative and artistic, and had no background in using design programs. Although I had a large learning curve at first, I finally started to enjoy designing.e writing, editing, designing, journalism, and communication skills I've gained during this degree, my career options are endless.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>With a major in Technical Communication and a minor in Design, my career goal is to be an Editor. While this originally was intended for content, I'm now open and knowledgeable about editing design, and doing document design. Because of all the various concentrations I learned, I can fit into many different types of Editing roles.</p>
